    "# Pathway\n",
    "> [Pathway](https://pathway.com/) is an open data processing framework. It allows you to easily develop data transformation pipelines and Machine Learning applications that work with live data sources and changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use a live `Pathway` data indexing pipeline with `Langchain`. You can query the results of this pipeline from your chains in the same manner as you would a regular vector store. However, under the hood, Pathway updates the index on each data change giving you always up-to-date answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use a [public demo document processing pipeline](https://pathway.com/solutions/ai-pipelines#try-it-out) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitors several cloud data sources for data changes.\n",
    "2. Builds a vector index for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To have your own document processing pipeline check the [hosted offering](https://pathway.com/solutions/ai-pipelines) or [build your own](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/vectorstore_pipeline/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will connect to the index using a `VectorStore` client, which implements the `similarity_search` function to retrieve matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic pipeline used in this document allows to effortlessly build a simple vector index of files stored in a cloud location. However, Pathway provides everything needed to build realtime data pipelines and apps, including SQL-like able operations such as groupby-reductions and joins between disparate data sources, time-based grouping and windowing of data, and a wide array of connectors.\n"
